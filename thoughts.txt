1) can we use the mean of the signal powers to find the actual power of the signal without the phase amp and de-amp effect?
2) for phase unwrapping, can we get a ML model of which k2pi to choose to put this current measurement in? The longer the time between measurements, the least likely we are to
be certain about the k. Some kind of filter? Maybe however close the measurement is to the changing of k is also part of the criterion
3) Can I not take the circles created by the solution of the problem and see if they change a lot in one direction but not in the other, then maybe the solution is the point that changes the least between movements? -- I need to understand the problem a lot better atm.
